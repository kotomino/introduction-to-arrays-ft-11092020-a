### Steps to create a repository

1. Created a folder to keep our projects in
2. Created a README.md, optionally created another file
3. We `git add .` in order to stage files to be commited.
4. We `git commit -m 'initial commit'` to create our initial commit.
5. We got to github.com/new to go to create a new repository.
6. We then clicked on the clipboard with the ssh url and typed in the terminal `git remote add origin <paste url here>`. Without the <>/
7. We then typed `git push -u origin master` in order to set the upstrean (default) location to origin (repository) master (branch) in gitHub.
